=======================================

Map out a technical solution for the food delivery site

* * *

### Request

A startup called ExpressFood has recruited me. They deliver high-quality meals to residences in less than 20 minutes with 
their team of delivery bikers. Every day, ExpressFood creates two main dishes and two desserts at its headquarters with 
the help of experienced chefs. These two main dishes are stored in a cold setting and then given to the driver who delivers 
food to the residence that requested it. My task was to design a database schema for them and implement it.

### Solution

I decided to use a robust and free database solution, MySQL. ExpressFood required access to a list of clients, different 
menu items, delivery people and order history. Additionally, I had to take into consideration that on its website, 
ExpressFood allows clients to order one or multiple dishes and desserts. There are no fees for delivery and menu items 
change every day. Once the client submits their order, they see a page displaying if the order has gone out for delivery 
yet, as well as an estimate for their meal's arrival time.
